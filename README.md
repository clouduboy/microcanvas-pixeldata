# PIF - Pixeldata Image Format
JavaScript library for handling different pixeldata formats and creating easing
the creation of monochrome pixelart for embedded devices's displays, such as the
[Arduboy](//github.com/arduboy/arduboy) Arduino-based gaming device and others.

## What is a PIF?
PIF is short for `P`ixeldata `I`mage `F`ormat, a plain-text-based intermediary
format to facilitate the creation and sharing of low-resolution, monochrome
image data.

These images are most frequently used in tiny, DIY LCD/LED/OLED displays in
conjunction with small embedded hardware. Creating such images should be
straightforward, but is hindered by the missing simple tooling and the
output requirement of a non-trivial binary pixelformat.
